# Kazari TODO List

Kazari is a desktop productivity app using Electron + Vite + TypeScript + React. It uses Pomodoro techniques with a fullscreen daily planning screen, floating countdown timers, and integrated task management from third-party sources.

- [x] Create base directory structure:
  - [x] `src/main/` - Electron main process
  - [x] `src/renderer/` - React application
  - [x] `src/shared/` - Shared types and utilities
  - [x] `src/data/` - Data management
  - [x] `src/integrations/` - Third-party integrations

    - [x] Implement graceful shutdown on fatal errors
    - [x] (Optional) Notify user of critical errors
    - [x] (Optional) Integrate crash/error reporting service (e.g., Sentry/Rollbar)

- [x] Add logging system:
  - [x] Set up electron-log
  - [x] Configure log levels
  - [x] Implement log rotation
  - [x] Add log file management
- [~] Create error reporting mechanism:
  - [~] Rollbar integration present, but no aggregation or notification UI

---

## React Renderer
