Please generate a prompt that instructs an LLM to perform the following tasks:

* Implement a notifications system for phase transitions, break reminders, and session completion.
* Support both in-app and system notifications, with user preferences for notification types.
* Ensure notifications are accessible and do not disrupt focus sessions unnecessarily.
* Follow the prompt structure as detailed in `.project/templates/00_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`. Write the prompt as Markdown and place it under the `prompts` directory as `15-notifications-system.md`.
