Please generate a prompt that instructs an LLM to perform the following tasks:

* Set up Vite-based configuration for all Electron entry points (main, preload, renderer).
* Ensure fast builds, hot reloading, and TypeScript support.
* Document the configuration and provide scripts for development, build, and packaging.
* Follow the prompt structure as detailed in `.project/templates/00_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`. Write the prompt as Markdown and place it under the `prompts` directory as `17-vite-configuration.md`.
