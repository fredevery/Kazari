Please generate a prompt that instructs an LLM to perform the following tasks:

* Implement the Break Screen system, including a full-screen break interface with a countdown timer and overrun feedback (negative timer, color change, or message).
* Allow the user to end the break and return to planning or focus at any time.
* Ensure the break timer continues into negative values after reaching zero and visually indicates overrun.
* Follow the prompt structure as detailed in `.project/templates/00_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`. Write the prompt as Markdown and place it under the `prompts` directory as `05-break-screen-system.md`.
