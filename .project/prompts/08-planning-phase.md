# Planning Phase Interface

The Planning Phase Interface provides users with structured daily and session planning capabilities that integrate seamlessly with the Task Management System and Pomodoro Timer System. This interface addresses the critical gap between having a list of tasks and effectively organizing them for productive work sessions. By providing dedicated planning workflows for both daily planning and pre-session preparation, it transforms task management from a reactive activity into a proactive productivity strategy that helps users prioritize effectively and maintain focus throughout their work sessions.

## Requirements

- Daily planning interface must allow users to review all pending tasks and set priorities for the day
- Session planning interface must appear before each focus session to help users select and prepare their next task
- System must support task prioritization through drag-and-drop reordering and explicit priority assignment
- Users must be able to set daily goals and track progress against those goals throughout the day
- Planning interface must provide task estimation review and adjustment capabilities before sessions
- System must maintain and update a sorted task list based on user prioritization decisions
- Planning workflows must integrate with the timer system to trigger at appropriate moments
- Interface must display task context, estimated duration, and completion status for informed decision-making
- Daily planning must support goal-setting with measurable targets (tasks completed, time focused, etc.)
- Session planning must show task history and suggest next logical tasks based on priority and context
- Planning data must persist across application restarts and sync across all windows
- System must track planning effectiveness through metrics (planned vs actual completion, priority accuracy)

## Domain

```typescript
// Core planning domain model
interface PlanningSession {
  id: string;
  type: PlanningType;
  date: Date;
  goals: DailyGoal[];
  prioritizedTasks: string[]; // Task IDs in priority order
  estimatedFocusTime: number; // in minutes
  actualResults?: PlanningResults;
  createdAt: Date;
  completedAt?: Date;
}

enum PlanningType {
  DAILY = 'daily',
  SESSION = 'session'
}

interface DailyGoal {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  type: GoalType;
  target: number;
  current: number;
  unit: string; // 'tasks', 'minutes', 'sessions'
  priority: number;
}

enum GoalType {
  TASK_COMPLETION = 'task_completion',
  FOCUS_TIME = 'focus_time',
  SESSION_COUNT = 'session_count',
  CUSTOM = 'custom'
}

interface PlanningResults {
  goalsAchieved: string[]; // Goal IDs
  tasksCompleted: string[]; // Task IDs
  totalFocusTime: number;
  planningAccuracy: number; // 0-1 score
  notes?: string;
}

interface SessionPlanningContext {
  availableTasks: Task[];
  recentHistory: SessionHistory[];
  dailyProgress: DailyProgress;
  timeRemaining: number; // minutes left in work day
  energyLevel?: EnergyLevel;
  suggestedTask?: string; // Task ID
}

enum EnergyLevel {
  LOW = 'low',
  MEDIUM = 'medium',
  HIGH = 'high'
}

interface PlanningPreferences {
  autoShowDailyPlanning: boolean;
  dailyPlanningTime: string; // HH:mm format
  showSessionPlanningFor: number; // session duration threshold
  prioritizationMethod: PrioritizationMethod;
  goalReminderInterval: number; // minutes
}

enum PrioritizationMethod {
  MANUAL = 'manual',
  EISENHOWER_MATRIX = 'eisenhower',
  TIME_BASED = 'time_based',
  ENERGY_BASED = 'energy_based'
}
```

## Extra Considerations

- Planning interfaces should be non-intrusive and easily dismissible if users prefer to skip planning
- Daily planning should be intelligent about when to appear (e.g., first session of the day, after long breaks)
- Session planning should consider task context switching costs and suggest related tasks
- Planning effectiveness should be measured and used to improve future suggestions
- Interface should work well with keyboard shortcuts for power users who prefer quick planning
- Planning data should be exportable for external productivity analysis tools
- System should handle cases where users have no tasks or very few tasks gracefully
- Planning workflows should be customizable based on user preferences and work patterns
- Integration with break screen system to show planning options during longer breaks

## Testing Considerations

The Planning Phase Interface requires comprehensive testing across multiple dimensions:

- **Unit Testing:** Test planning logic, goal calculation algorithms, prioritization methods, and state management
- **Integration Testing:** Verify planning interface integration with Task Management System, Timer System, and IPC communication
- **User Workflow Testing:** Test complete planning workflows from daily planning through session execution to goal achievement
- **State Persistence Testing:** Ensure planning data survives application restarts and syncs correctly across windows
- **Performance Testing:** Verify planning interface loads quickly even with large task lists and complex planning history
- **Accessibility Testing:** Ensure planning interfaces are accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers
- **Edge Case Testing:** Handle scenarios with no tasks, incomplete planning sessions, interrupted planning workflows

## Implementation Notes

- Use a modal or dedicated window for focused planning experiences that minimize distractions
- Implement planning workflows as a state machine to ensure proper flow and handle interruptions gracefully
- Prioritize keyboard accessibility for rapid planning workflows that don't interrupt user flow
- Use progressive enhancement - start with basic prioritization and add advanced features incrementally
- Implement intelligent defaults based on user behavior to minimize required planning decisions
- Consider user's historical patterns when suggesting planning workflows and goal targets
- Use subtle animations and transitions to make planning feel smooth and non-disruptive
- Store planning analytics to continuously improve the planning experience through usage patterns

## Specification by Example

### Daily Planning Workflow
```typescript
// User starts daily planning session
const dailyPlan = await planningService.startDailyPlanning();

// User sets goals for the day
await planningService.addDailyGoal({
  description: "Complete 3 high-priority development tasks",
  type: GoalType.TASK_COMPLETION,
  target: 3,
  unit: "tasks"
});

await planningService.addDailyGoal({
  description: "Focus for 4 hours total",
  type: GoalType.FOCUS_TIME,
  target: 240,
  unit: "minutes"
});

// User prioritizes tasks for the day
await planningService.prioritizeTasks([
  "task-123", // High priority bug fix
  "task-456", // Feature implementation
  "task-789"  // Code review
]);
```

### Session Planning Workflow
```typescript
// Before starting a focus session
const context = await planningService.getSessionContext();

// System suggests next task based on priority and context
const suggestion = await planningService.suggestNextTask(context);

// User confirms or selects different task
const selectedTask = await planningService.selectTaskForSession("task-123");

// Session starts with selected task
await timerService.startSession({ taskId: selectedTask.id });
```

### Goal Progress Tracking
```gherkin
Scenario: Daily goal progress updates automatically
  Given I have set a goal to complete 3 tasks today
  And I have completed 1 task so far
  When I complete another task during a focus session
  Then my goal progress should update to 2/3 tasks completed
  And the progress should be reflected in all open windows
  And goal achievement notifications should appear when I reach the target
```
