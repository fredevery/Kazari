# Task Management System

The Task Management System enables users to create, organize, and track their tasks throughout their productivity sessions. It integrates seamlessly with the Pomodoro Timer System to provide structured session planning, task prioritization, and completion tracking. This system addresses the common problem of staying organized and maintaining focus on the right tasks during productivity sessions. By allowing users to plan their sessions with specific tasks and track their progress, it transforms the basic Pomodoro technique into a comprehensive productivity workflow.

## Requirements

- Task creation must allow users to define task title, description, estimated duration, and priority level
- Tasks must be sortable by priority, estimated duration, creation date, and completion status
- Users must be able to mark tasks as completed during planning or session transitions
- System must track task completion metrics and update productivity analytics accordingly
- Task list must support session planning with the ability to select the next task for each session
- Tasks must persist across application restarts and be synchronized across all windows
- System must provide task filtering capabilities (completed, pending, high priority)
- Task completion must trigger productivity metric updates and session statistics
- Users must be able to edit task properties (title, description, priority, estimated duration)
- System must handle task deletion with confirmation to prevent accidental loss
- Task data must be exportable for external productivity analysis
- System must support bulk operations (mark multiple tasks as complete, delete multiple tasks)

## Domain

```typescript
// Core task management domain model
interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  priority: TaskPriority;
  estimatedDuration: number; // in minutes
  actualDuration?: number; // in minutes
  status: TaskStatus;
  createdAt: Date;
  completedAt?: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  tags: string[];
  sessionId?: string; // Link to timer session
}

enum TaskPriority {
  LOW = 'low',
  MEDIUM = 'medium',
  HIGH = 'high',
  URGENT = 'urgent'
}

enum TaskStatus {
  PENDING = 'pending',
  IN_PROGRESS = 'in_progress',
  COMPLETED = 'completed',
  CANCELLED = 'cancelled'
}

interface TaskFilter {
  status?: TaskStatus[];
  priority?: TaskPriority[];
  tags?: string[];
  dateRange?: {
    start: Date;
    end: Date;
  };
}

interface TaskSort {
  field: 'priority' | 'estimatedDuration' | 'createdAt' | 'completedAt' | 'title';
  direction: 'asc' | 'desc';
}

interface SessionPlan {
  id: string;
  tasks: Task[];
  currentTaskIndex: number;
  plannedDate: Date;
  actualStartTime?: Date;
  actualEndTime?: Date;
  completed: boolean;
}

class TaskManager {
  private tasks: Map<string, Task> = new Map();
  private currentSessionPlan?: SessionPlan;

  // Core task operations
  createTask(taskData: Omit<Task, 'id' | 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt'>): Task;
  updateTask(id: string, updates: Partial<Task>): Task;
  deleteTask(id: string): void;
  getTask(id: string): Task | undefined;
  getAllTasks(): Task[];
  
  // Task filtering and sorting
  filterTasks(filter: TaskFilter): Task[];
  sortTasks(tasks: Task[], sort: TaskSort): Task[];
  
  // Task completion and progress
  markTaskCompleted(id: string, actualDuration?: number): void;
  markTaskInProgress(id: string, sessionId: string): void;
  
  // Session planning
  createSessionPlan(taskIds: string[]): SessionPlan;
  getNextTaskForSession(): Task | undefined;
  completeCurrentTask(actualDuration: number): void;
  
  // Analytics and metrics
  getTaskMetrics(): TaskMetrics;
  getCompletionStats(dateRange?: DateRange): CompletionStats;
  
  // Bulk operations
  bulkMarkComplete(taskIds: string[]): void;
  bulkDelete(taskIds: string[]): void;
  
  // Data management
  exportTasks(format: 'json' | 'csv'): string;
  importTasks(data: string, format: 'json' | 'csv'): void;
  
  // Events for IPC communication
  on(event: 'taskCreated' | 'taskUpdated' | 'taskCompleted' | 'sessionPlanChanged', callback: Function): void;
  emit(event: string, data: any): void;
}

interface TaskMetrics {
  totalTasks: number;
  completedTasks: number;
  pendingTasks: number;
  averageCompletionTime: number; // in minutes
  productivityScore: number; // 0-100
  taskCompletionRate: number; // percentage
}

interface CompletionStats {
  tasksCompletedToday: number;
  tasksCompletedThisWeek: number;
  tasksCompletedThisMonth: number;
  averageTasksPerDay: number;
  mostProductiveDay: string;
  tasksByPriority: Record<TaskPriority, number>;
}
```

## Extra Considerations

- Task data must be validated before persistence to prevent corruption and ensure data integrity
- Large task lists must be efficiently handled without impacting application performance
- Task search functionality should support fuzzy matching and partial text search
- Task dependencies and relationships may need to be considered for future enhancements
- Task templates or recurring tasks might be valuable for common workflow patterns
- Integration with external task management systems (Todoist, Asana, etc.) for data sync
- Task time estimates should be compared with actual completion times to improve future planning
- Task categories or projects might be needed for better organization in complex workflows
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick task creation and manipulation should be implemented
- Task notifications and reminders based on priority and deadlines
- Backup and recovery mechanisms for task data to prevent accidental loss
- Multi-user support considerations for shared task lists in team environments

## Testing Considerations

Unit tests must achieve 95% code coverage for all task management logic, including task creation, updates, filtering, and sorting algorithms. Integration tests should verify proper IPC communication between main and renderer processes for task operations, ensuring all windows stay synchronized. End-to-end tests must validate complete task workflows from creation to completion, including session planning integration with the timer system. Performance tests should measure task list rendering and filtering performance with large datasets (1000+ tasks). Data integrity tests must verify task persistence, corruption recovery, and migration between application versions. User acceptance tests should validate task management workflows match user expectations and productivity needs.

## Implementation Notes

Use TypeScript for comprehensive type safety and better developer experience. Implement task storage using a combination of in-memory caching and file-based persistence (JSON or SQLite). Use indexed data structures (Map, Set) for efficient task lookup and filtering operations. Implement optimistic updates in the UI with proper error handling and rollback mechanisms. Use the Observer pattern for real-time task updates across multiple windows. Implement proper validation layers for task data to prevent corruption. Use debouncing for search and filter operations to maintain performance. Follow clean architecture principles with clear separation between domain logic, application services, and infrastructure concerns. Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages and recovery options.

## Specification by Example

```typescript
// Example task creation and management workflow
const taskManager = new TaskManager();

// Create a new task
const task = taskManager.createTask({
  title: "Implement user authentication",
  description: "Add login/logout functionality with JWT tokens",
  priority: TaskPriority.HIGH,
  estimatedDuration: 120, // 2 hours
  status: TaskStatus.PENDING,
  tags: ['development', 'authentication', 'security']
});

// Task object result
// {
//   id: "task_001",
//   title: "Implement user authentication",
//   description: "Add login/logout functionality with JWT tokens",
//   priority: "high",
//   estimatedDuration: 120,
//   status: "pending",
//   createdAt: "2025-07-18T10:30:00.000Z",
//   updatedAt: "2025-07-18T10:30:00.000Z",
//   tags: ['development', 'authentication', 'security']
// }

// Filter high priority tasks
const highPriorityTasks = taskManager.filterTasks({
  priority: [TaskPriority.HIGH, TaskPriority.URGENT]
});

// Create session plan with selected tasks
const sessionPlan = taskManager.createSessionPlan([
  "task_001", "task_002", "task_003"
]);

// Mark task as in progress when starting a session
taskManager.markTaskInProgress("task_001", "session_001");

// Complete task after session
taskManager.markTaskCompleted("task_001", 95); // actual duration in minutes
```

```javascript
// Example IPC communication
// Main process
ipcMain.handle('task:create', (event, taskData) => {
  const task = taskManager.createTask(taskData);
  // Broadcast to all windows
  BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().forEach(window => {
    window.webContents.send('task:created', task);
  });
  return task;
});

ipcMain.handle('task:getAll', () => {
  return taskManager.getAllTasks();
});

ipcMain.handle('task:complete', (event, taskId, actualDuration) => {
  taskManager.markTaskCompleted(taskId, actualDuration);
  const updatedTask = taskManager.getTask(taskId);
  // Broadcast completion to all windows
  BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().forEach(window => {
    window.webContents.send('task:completed', updatedTask);
  });
  return updatedTask;
});

// Renderer process
const createTask = async (taskData) => {
  const newTask = await ipcRenderer.invoke('task:create', taskData);
  updateTaskList(newTask);
};

const completeTask = async (taskId, actualDuration) => {
  const completedTask = await ipcRenderer.invoke('task:complete', taskId, actualDuration);
  updateTaskMetrics();
};

// Listen for task updates from other windows
ipcRenderer.on('task:created', (event, task) => {
  addTaskToList(task);
});

ipcRenderer.on('task:completed', (event, task) => {
  updateTaskInList(task);
  updateMetrics();
});
```

# Example Gherkin scenarios for task management
Feature: Task Management
  As a productivity user
  I want to manage my tasks effectively
  So that I can stay organized and focused during my work sessions

  Scenario: Creating a new task
    Given I am on the task management screen
    When I click "Add Task"
    And I enter "Write project documentation" as the title
    And I set the priority to "High"
    And I set the estimated duration to "90 minutes"
    And I click "Save"
    Then the task should be added to my task list
    And the task should be marked as "Pending"

  Scenario: Completing a task during a session
    Given I have a task "Fix login bug" in progress
    And I am in an active focus session
    When the session ends
    And I mark the task as completed
    Then the task status should change to "Completed"
    And the actual duration should be recorded
    And my productivity metrics should be updated

  Scenario: Planning a session with tasks
    Given I have multiple pending tasks
    When I select tasks for my next session
    And I create a session plan
    Then the tasks should be ordered by priority
    And the session plan should be saved
    And the first task should be ready to start
```
