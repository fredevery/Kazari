# Productivity Analytics System

_Implement a comprehensive productivity analytics system that tracks user performance, calculates meaningful metrics, and provides actionable insights. This system should integrate seamlessly with the existing timer and task management functionality to provide real-time analytics on the Dashboard, enabling users to understand their productivity patterns and make data-driven improvements to their workflow._

## Requirements

_Specific, measurable acceptance criteria that define when this feature is complete._

- Real-time calculation and display of productivity metrics including focus time, break adherence, task completion rates, and session efficiency
- Historical analytics data persisted securely with the ability to view trends over customizable time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- Dashboard integration displaying key productivity insights with interactive charts and visualizations
- Progress tracking functionality that shows goal achievement and productivity streaks
- Automated insights generation that identifies patterns and provides recommendations for productivity improvement
- Export functionality for analytics data in standard formats (CSV, JSON) for external analysis
- Privacy-focused implementation ensuring all analytics data remains local and secure
- Performance optimization to ensure analytics calculations don't impact timer or task management functionality

## Rules

_Rules files that should be included when working on this feature._

- rules/domain-driven-design-rules.md
- rules/hexagonal-architecture.md
- rules/state-management.md
- rules/typescript-standards.md
- rules/error-handling.md
- rules/build-configuration.md

## Domain

_Core domain model for the productivity analytics system._

```typescript
// Core Analytics Domain Model

interface ProductivityMetrics {
  readonly focusTime: Duration;
  readonly breakTime: Duration;
  readonly tasksCompleted: number;
  readonly sessionsCompleted: number;
  readonly efficiency: EfficiencyScore;
  readonly streakDays: number;
  readonly goalAchievement: GoalProgress;
}

interface AnalyticsTimeframe {
  readonly period: 'day' | 'week' | 'month' | 'quarter' | 'year';
  readonly startDate: Date;
  readonly endDate: Date;
}

interface ProductivityInsight {
  readonly id: InsightId;
  readonly type: InsightType;
  readonly title: string;
  readonly description: string;
  readonly impact: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  readonly recommendation: string;
  readonly generatedAt: Date;
}

interface AnalyticsRepository {
  calculateMetrics(timeframe: AnalyticsTimeframe): Promise<ProductivityMetrics>;
  getHistoricalData(timeframe: AnalyticsTimeframe): Promise<readonly AnalyticsDataPoint[]>;
  generateInsights(metrics: ProductivityMetrics): Promise<readonly ProductivityInsight[]>;
  exportData(timeframe: AnalyticsTimeframe, format: ExportFormat): Promise<ExportResult>;
}

interface AnalyticsService {
  trackSessionCompletion(session: CompletedSession): Promise<void>;
  trackTaskCompletion(task: CompletedTask): Promise<void>;
  trackBreakAdherence(breakData: BreakMetrics): Promise<void>;
  updateRealTimeMetrics(): Promise<ProductivityMetrics>;
}
```

## Extra Considerations

_Important factors requiring special attention during implementation._

- Analytics calculations must not block the main thread or interfere with timer precision
- Historical data storage should be optimized for both space efficiency and query performance
- Insight generation algorithms should be extensible to allow for new productivity patterns
- User privacy must be maintained with local-only data storage and no external analytics services
- Data aggregation strategies need to handle edge cases like incomplete sessions or system crashes
- Memory management for large datasets when viewing historical analytics over extended periods
- Graceful degradation when analytics data is corrupted or incomplete
- Integration with existing notification system for productivity milestone alerts

## Testing Considerations

_Testing strategy for the productivity analytics system._

- Unit tests for all analytics calculation algorithms with edge cases and boundary conditions
- Integration tests for analytics service interaction with timer and task management systems
- Performance tests to ensure analytics calculations complete within acceptable time limits
- Data integrity tests for analytics persistence and historical data accuracy
- UI tests for Dashboard analytics components with various data scenarios (empty, sparse, dense)
- Mock data generators for testing analytics with realistic productivity patterns
- End-to-end tests for complete analytics workflows from data collection to insight generation
- Memory and performance benchmarks for large historical datasets

## Implementation Notes

_Architectural preferences and technical constraints._

- Follow hexagonal architecture with clear ports for analytics data access and persistence
- Use domain-driven design principles with analytics as a bounded context
- Implement analytics calculations as pure functions for testability and reliability
- Apply state management rules with analytics state managed in the main process
- Use TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive type safety for all analytics interfaces
- Implement lazy loading for historical data to minimize memory usage
- Use worker threads for intensive analytics calculations to avoid blocking the UI
- Follow existing IPC patterns for analytics data communication between processes
- Ensure all analytics components are accessible according to accessibility guidelines

## Specification by Example

_Concrete examples of the productivity analytics functionality._

### Analytics Dashboard Display
```typescript
// Example productivity metrics for today
const todayMetrics = {
  focusTime: Duration.fromMinutes(240), // 4 hours
  breakTime: Duration.fromMinutes(45),  // 45 minutes
  tasksCompleted: 8,
  sessionsCompleted: 12,
  efficiency: 0.85, // 85% efficiency score
  streakDays: 5,
  goalAchievement: {
    dailyFocusGoal: { target: 300, achieved: 240, percentage: 0.80 },
    tasksGoal: { target: 10, achieved: 8, percentage: 0.80 }
  }
};
```

### Historical Data Query
```typescript
// Get weekly productivity trends
const weeklyData = await analyticsRepository.getHistoricalData({
  period: 'week',
  startDate: new Date('2025-07-15'),
  endDate: new Date('2025-07-21')
});
// Returns array of daily metrics for the week
```

### Productivity Insights
```typescript
// Example generated insight
const insight = {
  id: 'insight_001',
  type: 'break_adherence',
  title: 'Improving Break Consistency',
  description: 'You skip breaks 30% more often on Mondays compared to other weekdays',
  impact: 'medium',
  recommendation: 'Consider scheduling important meetings away from Monday mornings to maintain break routine',
  generatedAt: new Date()
};
```

### Export Functionality
```csv
Date,Focus Time (min),Break Time (min),Tasks Completed,Sessions,Efficiency
2025-07-21,240,45,8,12,0.85
2025-07-20,210,60,6,10,0.78
2025-07-19,180,30,5,8,0.82
```
