# [Feature/System Name]

_Write a brief paragraph describing the high-level purpose and context. What problem does this solve? What is the main objective? Keep this concise and focused on the "why" rather than the "how"._

## Requirements

_List the specific, measurable acceptance criteria that define when this feature is complete. These should be testable and unambiguous. Think of these as your definition of done._

- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2
- Requirement 3

## Rules

_Specify any rules files that should be included when working on this feature. This includes any rules files that might be relevant for this slice to be implemented. The rules files are usually found under the `rules/` directory of this project._

- rules/my-rules-1.md
- rules/my-rules-2.md
- rules/my-rules-3.md

## Domain

_If applicable, describe the core domain model using pseudo-code in a modern language like TypeScript or Kotlin. Focus on the key entities, relationships, and business logic. This section helps establish the mental model for the feature._

// Core domain representation in markdown block

## Extra Considerations

_List important factors that need special attention during implementation. This often grows as you discover edge cases or constraints during development. Think about non-functional requirements, constraints, or gotchas._

- Consideration 1
- Consideration 2
- Consideration 3

## Testing Considerations

_Describe how you want this feature to be tested. What types of tests are needed? What scenarios should be covered? What are the quality gates?_

_Examples: unit test coverage requirements, integration testing adapters, acceptance testing a workflow, performance benchmarks, etc._

## Implementation Notes

_Document your preferences for how this should be built. This might include architectural patterns, coding standards, technology choices, or specific approaches you want followed._

_Examples: preferred design patterns, coding style, performance requirements, technology constraints_

## Specification by Example

_Provide concrete examples of what the feature should do. This could be API request/response examples, Gherkin scenarios, sample CSV representation, or user interaction flows. Make the abstract requirements tangible._

_Examples: Gherkin scenarios, JSON payload, UI mockups, CSV samples_

## Verification

_Create a checklist to verify that the feature is complete and working correctly. These should be actionable items that can be checked off systematically._

- [ ] Verification item 1
- [ ] Verification item 2
- [ ] Verification item 3
