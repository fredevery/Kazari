- Only make changes to files when I specifically tell you to
- When I ask you to suggest an implementation or solution, print your suggestion into the chat
- Print out implementation suggestion in the chat and I will implement them
- When I use the term "make it so", that should signal to you that I have given consent for you to make the files changes needed to implement your suggestion.
- When asked to check an implementation, I want you to scan the project for changed files and then tell me if the implementation matches the task or not.
